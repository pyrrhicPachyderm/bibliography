My bibliography for my ecology papers and projects.

This is intended as a compilation of all the relevant papers (and other sources) I've thoroughly read for such projects, from the inception of this repository onwards.
It also contains my notes on the papers.

This does not necessarily form a complete bibliography of every paper I cite.
Papers outside of my main field may not be included here.
Particularly, papers cited by coauthors may not be included here, and will not be if I haven't read them.
Such papers will be included in a project-specific bibliography file, or better, a coauthor's personal equivalent of this repository.

The intent is that this repository be included in each project that uses it using git submodules.
